Algorithm Question: 
Given a string, write an algorithm that will determiine if it is palngrome.

Questions as from interviwers: 
1. Just to confirm "Palindrome" is a sentence or word that reads the same backward and forward?!
For example: 
Palindrom is:

Anna = Anna
Elle = elle
madam = madam 

BUT NOT:
ELLEN = since its ELLEN when you read backward, its actually Nelle? 

2. How do we handle punctuatons or numbers?
interviewers: you can skip over those for now.
